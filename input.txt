lovely hotel unique decor friendly desk staff central location recently started staying boutique hotels definitely not expert subtleties types establishments provide 
stayed kimptons say experiences good 
hotel monaco no exception 
decor kimpton hotels unique wonderful way pulling colors textures patterns feels cool trendy comfortable 
lobby lounge decorated really nicely rich tones 
room provided nice view modern romantic shabby-chic feel lack better description 
staff friendly helpful attitude 
sazerac restaurant served delicious breakfast really great setting 
seattle cute town hotel enhanced stay 
location ideal

remember library right street 
gorgeous architecture 
overall nice hotel stay 
gave 4-stars recently stayed shangri-la wowed experience

wonderful touch.eventually ordered cake room service delivered candles provided hotel

honestly say hotel dead quiet night actually wondered floor 
beds quite comfortable husband took issue pillows 
things considered think pass

wonderful hotel second time husband stayed monaco hotel

ordered great mix tapas ah goat cheese pine nut-stuffed dates desserts 
second night lampreia 
n't like nouvelle cuisine lots attention wo n't like food small unusual presentations slightly smothering service

definitely disppointment 
decor room hotel envisioned nice 
housekeeping staff impressive extremely polite cheery helpful 
desk bellmen standard customer service 
lots little things easily overlooked broken make mirror sagging post bathroom jiggly entrance handle room did n't feel secure handle nearly falling door 
husband early morning flight mid-week asked cab called 
suggested cab ride cost double private car flat-rate n't case 
knew cost cab 30 car 38 bell staff insisted like 65 taxi ride 
cab driver later explained bell staff kick referrals 
preferred guests city and/or hotel hotel staff looking best interests 
new years planned dining restaurant hotel new year day 
came dressed dinner told desk closed holiday 
asked nearby response good luck finding today 
good luck 
thanks help 
feature needed hotel business centre work 
downstairs service completely semi-funcitional 
internet service out-sourced ended spending 50 money n't work no refund 2.5 hours vacation time trouble-shooting internet company toll free service line 
asked desk times assistance told 
worst experience time asked desk assistance got response included shrug say oh bad 
majority staff attitude just simply did not care needed help dared intrude time got snotty response 
occasions caught desk girls smirking thought turned n't 
talk frustrating 
honesty n't wait check

room looked nothing like elegant ones advertised hotel staying wonderful san francisco monaco expectations high booked hotel 
especially monaco seattle 100 dollars sf monaco 
traveling home copenhagen considered using priceline bid low star hotel

lobby beautiful staff allowed generous 3pm checkout relax overseas flight 
room quiet clean worked.but surprised room decorated hideously 
room got did not way shape form resemble beautifully designed rooms advertised hotels web site 
pillows beds left chairs no bedspread 
wall paper grey white depressing 
sf loved monaco whimsical colorful style no color design room 
felt really misrepresented rooms dull boring 
nice decor helps make feel home cheers room didnt trick 
actually factor decor book room sure photos advertised usually bit polished reality monaco seattle pure misreprentation decor advertised.at san francisco monaco lovely spa sauna big hot tub 
seattle paid 100 dollars sf no spa 
finally room service menu did not include vegetarian dishes pizza 
like no brainer consider vegetarians make room service menu 
include dogs not cover 10 percent population doesnt eat meat

not impressed 
booked 4* hotel strength recommendations trip advisor boy disappointed 
previous selections great sucess thought increase budget slightly stay 2 nights way home 
travelling 2 small children 57 booked room all.the lobby hotel small gloomy 2 inconvenient steps just sums hotel 
received lukewarm welcome check early evening weak offer help parking luggage 
room dark 2 small double beds view spaceneedle 
bathroom dated compared hotels just visited pretty pathetic shower hole ceiling.we asked guest services recomendations children friendly restaurants staff shrugged shoulders member staff called dave came help 
helpful member staff came entire stay 
gave directions advised portion sizes 
times contacted desk/guest services difficult tell apart met unhelpful unknowledgable staff straightforward requests verging sarcastic rude 
enquired breakfast restaurants whale watching tours pottery barn locations ended doing research bookings 
standard housekeeping not good maid did n't remove replace dirty cups glasses wanted room 8am day checking out.we ate breakfast hotel waitress mature lady started giving children sitting quitely lecture behaving good parents 
slow service given nearly restaurant.the hotel located centrally able walk places parking 27 day guests thought pricey 
told desk internet access laptop free checkout 11 day added 
questioned told told remove feel pretty bad it.overall dark dated hotel let badly unhelpful rude staff 
n't believe previous excellent tripadvisor reports

watch 
previous positive reviews given room 
just hope room ahead booked hotel hotwire misleading listed hotel pike street market hotel 
not 5 long city blocks away 
lists boutique hotel make sound quaint guess 
translate old unrelenting.we called ahead specifically needed beds medical reasons 
checked early secure room 
told counter help room locked 14th floor beds 
returned 6 p.m. told increased business room changed room king bed small lower floor.now told check early higher floor room beds 
not 
say room locked grade inexcusable 
regret did n't wear new trip adviser hat 
desk rude cutting sentences midway tell did n't matter told crowd come sold room 
spent sleepless night lower floor husband needed bed 
rude 
n't apologetic 
ridiculous 
stay 
beware rooms small outdated pool smells like mildew 
seriously 
basically told booked hotwire n't preferred customer 
n't realize power trip adviser 
recommendation save money 
better hotels nearby appreciate business work 
n't great location certainly not worth treated pond scum using hotwire people saved money stupid 
advise spend earned money king motel 1/2 block away sheraton weston

avoid possible not terribly critical person really hated hotel 
good points example cheaper options downtown seattle decent location 
not center downtown like hotels 5 6 block walk positives 
rooms dark furniture really old mismatched 
gives impression dirty soon walk 
far cleanliness just okay kind place makes feel need check sheets crawling bed 
blankets really really worn sheets clean 
crap shoot.my biggest problem room freezing 
balconies not meant actually standing drafty room unbearably cold 
turned thermostat did n't help 
actually kicked smell came vent disgusting 
smelled like mold mildew 
actually turned heat froze just n't subjected smell.anyway thought hotel okay not planning really just needed convenient location sleep 
stayed realize just cost effective spend little stay provided comfort 
warwick charges 23 think parking 12 internet day 
time add extras stayed red lion hotel monaco slightly 
going seattle look hard spending little extra hotel probably end right center downtown

right small hotel travel business prefer relatively small hotels instead huge name-brand dormatories 
seattle warwick 
rooms not 2000. personable staff 
free shutle rides appointments downtown 
tiny excertise room pool adequate restaurant 24 hour room service 
rates lower famous people barns street 
pleasant experience.ps 
hotel upgrade process refurbished rooms come 20 premium 
worth

ok hotel good location watch construction noise just returned 3-night stay hotel warwick 
agree previous posters staff nice location convenient 
hotel easy walk downtown shopping areas seattle center attractions 
overall enjoyed stay problems worth mentioning.we chose hotel rooms feature outside balcony 
husband smokes not prefer smoking room windows outside balcony minimize smoke inside room 
preference advised balconies barely wide fit human 
did not feel safe actually standing balcony especially balcony door closed 
smokers beware hotel smoking rooms located second floor 
floor public meeting rooms restrooms restaurant bar located 
requested smoking room upper floor space needle view 
given smoking room 2nd floor 
no space needle no view 
obviously not renovated rooms 
ceiling light fixtures dozen 1970s-era cans track lighting set rows ceiling directed bed 
felt like starring intimate film 
bathroom paper towel dispenser like public restroom strange pink goo soap dispenser looked like n't changed track lighting installed 
traffic noise incredibly loud hotel construction noise started early 
late flight desk unable change room check-in told come day 
changed nonsmoking 7th floor room day thankfully updated 
traffic noise little better floors nice space needle view 
bed comfortable amenities average 
liked in-room refrigerator 
intermittent construction noise hotel 
hotel renovations ongoing noise n't bad weekend care staying week 
smoke detector room not operational device unhooked sitting closet 
called maintenance hooked did n't stay.we did not use pool jacuzzi 
previous poster noted spa facilities basement felt isolated comfort 
liked bar quite bit 
friendly staff good drinks draft beer selection nice atmosphere 
ate bar night primarily convenience 
certainly better places eat seattle food ok nice time 
concierge helpful helping select restaurant perfect tastes making dinner reservations 
lobby fireplace added cheerful cozy ambience enjoyed warming sightseeing 
probably want check different hotel time seattle 
avoid second floor rooms n't mind little construction noise hotel warwick convenient friendly generally comfortable place stay

rainier waterfront water view room 
took pictures deck just stood admired view 
nice place strike conversation guests overall nice place escape hustle market area below.our room lovely spacious saw no signs wear tear reviews mentioned 
bathroom room size small bedroom 
thing really loved bathroom shelving unit available bathroom things 
hotel offer n't live completely suitcase thousand things toilet simply handy.the tempurpedic bed got mixed review 
no issues quite comfortable

breakfast went market bagel shop 1st ave. 1/2 block south hotel inexpensive breakfast couple days

men bring luggage cabs went great lengths help 
desk staff certainly pleasant helpful did n't know touch company mt

no brochures available lobby desk person went looking drawer difficulty finding brochure major attraction 
finally suggested gray line phone gave incorrect information saw later thought accurate n't blame

addition did book tour asked wake came 
fortunately set cell phone

simple fact hotel location simply unbeatable.. mere stone throw away pike market 
plenty great restaurants generally fun area

quality hotel so-so 
not place business travellers

wireless internet no place work bed 
2. furniture coverings worned just outdated 
3. room 409 city view room 
room date 
avoid cost window sits right bus stop 
claim windows double paned hear buses roaring engines 
sleep ear plugs desk 
4. ac standalone unit attached wall 
not central

looks cheap tacky 
5. no business center

great vacation business travelers inn market offers superb location near seattle pike place market tranquil well-appointed guest rooms 
hotel steps excellent campagne restaurant pricey worthwhile superb 94 stewart street marvelous modern american fare exceptional wine cheese choices numerous notable restaurant choices 
excellent shopping nearby.i recommend inn market unreservedly vacation seattle 
staff friendly room comfortable restful location not improved 
small quibble no lobby shop sundries unfortunately hotel distance drugstore.if business traveler send vintage park monaco olympic seasons following reasons 1 no desk task lighting 
windowed table room did not task lighting nearby 
order flashlight read paperwork working night

best location bit overpriced stayed inn market weekend getaway seattle 
hotel nice location not beat challenge centrally located place stay downtown seattle 
rooms average bathrooms huge nice 
echo previous negative review state price range expect lot 
paid 165 night iatm 200 sheraton previous trip 
sheraton n't centrally located iatm felt like staying 200/night hotel nice 
things stand iatm:1. valet parking expensive 25 night 
expedia notes free parking option apparently not correct 
fact no alternative valet parking unless want park outdoor unsecure lot block away.2 
ceiling lights room housekeeping did n't fix pointing them.3 
telephone did n't work way dial 0.4. television room inexplicably located directly left bed 
watch tv required sit sideways bed lay side.5 
foam posturpedic beds hear lot people like nearly paralyzed wife pain 
guess hotel ca n't held responsible sure people like options people n't 
surely wo n't buying matresses time soon.overall not bad hotel just bit 
guess pay lot location bit opinion 
probably not come price

days later received email hotel thanking staying hope enjoyed stay responded email outlining frustrations accomodation 
not like time really needed air dissatisfaction

so-called compensatory offer acknowledged

storing salmon bought fridge holding luggage went sightseeing day calling cab late night 
willing accommodate accordingly

husband oldest guests hotel years felt uncomfortable unwelcome

bit surprised hotels.com guaranteed king size bed double 
asked jabriil mixup having booked hotels.com explained overlap booking 
room bed comfortable decent size large clean bathroom 
not high maintenance like read night no reading lamp room just overhead recessed lighting 
jabriil came rescue small reading lamp extra pillows 
clean-pillows obviously sprayed lysol uses-but no biggie 
thing missing room place hang clothes couple hangers 
night did smaller room 
size bed smaller bathroom-a bit noisier stairwell 
quite comfortable slept 
plusses justin jibriil-definitely nicest guys unpretentious friendly helpful

ace hotel 
like 7 clubs 
currently staying ace hotel business hotels downtown booked 
hotel decent like 2 star based experiences 
overall experience just ok. room deluxe room according hotel n't deluxe-it just means avoid sharing bathroom 
summary pros location-plenty bars restaurants choose 
convinience store street 
easy walk downtown 10 minutes 
n't want walk bus stop right outside hotel frequent service 
walk block closer downtown free ride zone save 1.25/1.50 rush hour.wireless intenet includedthe hotel clean.small continental breakfast included featuring toast granola cereal juice included price.cons no elevator entry climb decent flight stairs reception area 
not big deal young hassle got heavy luggage.receptionists friendly tell part-time work n't interested comings goings people 
walked past numerous times hours night look coming hotel simple greeting.rooms small just bed tiny desk chair 
deluxe 
decor trying boutique-y just looks like sanatorium 
walls hallways rooms white 
no closet drawers speak luggage clothes floor small room 
metal hangars hanging coat hanger wall hear clanking night morning adjacent room 
bathroom ok size looks cheap stand-up shower toilet open u-faced seating like airport store n't big deal towel holder placed right folded stacked jammed towel easy pull rest fall toilet not real smart thinking ace 
naked lightbulb serves lighting room adds hostel/sanitorium/potential flophouse hotel effect 
clincher tv wall arm extending ceiling 
nothing like tv attached wall/ceiling motel feeling.also leave service room tag door leave not housekeeping 
try sell leaving think saving money.summation location options available price range hotel decent option 
boutique hotel experience charge discounted corporate rate 160 night plain room measures 15x15 seattle 
definitely not aces

breakfast lunch twice appetizers bar twice

rooms worn outdated 
furniture nicked wall paper peeling carpet seams lifting- executive suite.the elevators loud- actually appreciated loud heater drowned noise elevators hallway hear conversation walls doors not working lightbulbs lamps

nice issues second stay location 
great view nice room 
priority club member intercontinental hotels loyalty program given nice little package arrival told locate complimentary drinks snacks refrigerator room 
guessed no fridge no snacks no drinks 
not big deal just irritating 
elevators slow 
minutes lobby 
water pressure/hot water room abysmal.valet parking mandatory costs 30.00/day 
ridiculous par course seattle 
good nicely accoutremented room save missing fridge brand new huge flatscreen comfy beds/linens giant window look city 
spectacular view 
internet service fast worked 80 time 
set 10.00/day 
recommend cautiously 
like just little bang buck prices

not bad not great family 2 adutls 2 children stayed crowne plaza end june 
overall hotel fine basic categories rooms fairly nice comfortable beds nice lcd tv clean 
hotel good location 
10 minutes walking leisurely waterfront walk qwest safeco field got time 
similarly seattle center n't far reached mono rail 5 blocks hotel 
middling review say 
booked hotwire paying 100 night hotel 
little disappointed 
biggest complaints incidental charges 
know no free lunches not stayed hotel years did n't provide wifi room rate 9.95 tv internet think regular lap connection 
hotel parking garage valet parking goes 35 day 
thought outrageous discovered parking costs seattle really parking nearly half room rate night 
read review elevators long long time true not type thing upset 
n't like dimed 
say hotel acceptable not affordable looks probably n't stay based combination 
think better value cost hassle charged things generally not expect pay

great potential problems hotel lot going pleasant professional staff nice decor comfortable bedding great location stunning views rooms 
nonetheless needs not stay 
biggest problem internet access room extremely weak wi-fi 
hotel internet access work slows dies works dies 
argh 
spent long time phone tech support no avail 
hotel staff honest lot customers complain internet access 
business class high level tourist hotel offer reliable fast internet 
internet integral life 
experienced problems hotel slow elevators 
elevator capacity appears inadequate size hotel 
staff missing action busy bar scene no bartender no staff extended period. 
finally parking available valet ok valet brought wrong car does mistake honda accord ford escape 
ultimately hotel great potential suffers highly irritating easily fixable problems slow elevators highly irritating prove hard fix

nice comfortable stay people ask stay hotel say yes 
just careful room in.i stayed marqueen 4 nights business trip 
review mentioning noise thought having spacious comfortable room important 
arrived couple asked prefer quiet room 
took quiet room 3rd floor 
checking desk person did not ask preference just let took room gave 
turned direct noisy bar 2nd floor room 204. n't noisy checked 4 pm 
wed. noise bar started 9 pm ended 2:30 
window shut hear screaming guys gals smoking outside bar 
believe hotel knew noise problem bar set ear plugs snack basket guest 
use ear plugs night 
weekday not imagine noisy weekend 
morning changed quiet room 3rd floor facing backside building 
rest stay wonderful 
funny thing loud noise problem think staying hotel gave sense living seattle 
loved 
maybe hotel kind like apartment feel like living 
having kitchen dining area nice 
nice separate living area sofa coffee table.one thing car parking hotel tough 
lot restriction street parking 
expect pay 20 day valet parking hotel 
able car day 
pay tip valet parker.when went downtown meet husband walked monorail just 10 min nice walk hotel 
monorail takes 2 min westlake shopping center center downtown 
decided stay marqueen avoid room 2nd floor facing street 
want quiet room ask 3rd floor facing building

mattress pad mattress wet did n't notice going bed called desk offered come change sheets 
late changing sheets n't help wet mattress pad 
piled towels robes tried sleep 
room faced queen street right loud bar 
closing time approached party fights poured street 
noise lasted hours included people smashing bottles loud swearing car alarms going yelling just bunch noise closed window ac n't possibly drown 
happened friday saturday nights.we early morning meeting returned meetings asked staff taken care bed 
person manager lobby

blamed leaving not disturb sign door 
no message saying tried fix problem

checked learned charged minute rate published maximum rate 
brought attention desk staffer said n't no authority 
asked speak authority person came office 
person defensive pricing really felt like taken cleaners 
raised issue wet bed no tended having room right noisy bar offered free parking 30 value expected pay 255 night 30 higher maximum published price kept saying nothing requested discount troubles met defensiveness extreme rudeness 
final insult car parked outside hotel loading zone checking just loaded bags car proper area 
spent 20 minutes dealing desk staff problems pricing unresolved wet bed problem not able sleep bar bellman glared snarled directly saying blocking traffic incoming guests causing big traffic jam street.we appalled issues blatantly ignored 
truly place business ripping guests did n't care reputation 
add stayed hotels world seen rude service.after spending 20 minutes desk expecting hefty discount price gouging wet bed sleepless nights got frustrated no left manager 
days later manager not bothered n't returned either.we stay certain tell friends poor ethics lack customer service

positives-1 great service- far bellhops/valet housekeeping 
getting car relatively quick long wait supposedly hotel fully booked time room cleaned timely basis 
time thought lost phone come room valet searched car pulled car helped look again.2 location-short walk pike place market connected westlake center monorail/stores/food court 3 king suite spacious refrigerator wet bar convenient bring drinks walgreens rite aid 2 blocks away 2 tv 2 thermostats bedroom sofa area negatives-1 noise level-note rooms street room sat right corner olive 4th n't know higher floors hotel 12 stories tall lower floors defintely hear road noise buses cars worse open window 
light sleeper make sure ask high room 
noise did n't bother did n't need alarm morning buses passing by.2 no safe room-i hotels one3 2 elevators-not really big deal slow staff use elevators times wait not bad unless impatient elevator small side4 not stroller friendly-there 2 entrances hotel flight like 10 steps main entrance use entrance 
connection westlake center mezzanine level 15 stairs 
elevator small.5 chance getting good view-remember 12 floors think upper floors want water space needle 
compared westin street super tall sure better chance getting better view not views okay looking street overall pleased room hotel n't mind staying

underwhelming not bad choice husband stayed 3 nights mayflower park july 2006. chose central location walking distance pikes market space needle ferry terminal monorail 
price-point 215/night plus tax good reviews 
biggest problem room air conditioning not working 
close 80 degrees room 
engineer came twice problem fixed 
ultimately engineer admitted room problem did room floor 
ask moved room no offer 
substitute room looked brick wall 
appeared single bed not queen nightstand no table reading chair room 
room rate adjusted lesser room just ended feeling like hotel did n't care minimum necessary 
sunday room not 4:30 afternoon day returned hoping relax 
prepared incorrectly double-charged 
hotel provides free internet access not easily no told 
not awful problems just annoying 
mayflower place lots brass trim big flower arrangements lobby room service want ice 
style air conditioning room working think mayflower fair choice 
like favor modern accommodations no opulent frllls consistent quality feeling valued customer 
end deciding mayflower park bit underwhelming

dingy good location relatively inexpensive husband 12-day trip los angeles seattle untimately san francisco 
spent 3 nights seattle moore hotel 
admit cheap comes paying lodging especially sleep not taking advantages amenities 
hand pay 
5th floor 
slowly remodeling hotel 3rd floor newly painted nice light fixtures halls did n't rooms opposed floor dingy creepy kind like place shining.the room basically 
decent sized room dresser tv nightstand phone bed 
no desk chair 
sit bed 
walk-in closet nearly big room non issue 
no a/c small fan tv 
did n't need ac weather cool late july 
downside open windows not place small children n't screens breeze 
terribly loud night sleep 
carpet creepy not necessarily dirty dingy kept shoes feet times.the bathroom pits 
old step 18 smallest shower seen 
thing killed not sure toilet did n't cover 
just seat 
like using bathroom rest stop 
bathroom small no place toiletries afraid precariously perched edge sink going fall toilet 
carried lot toilet not having cover think husband got tired listening just really strange 
stayed quality inn los angeles moore hotel qi coffee makers room continental breakfast free parking way nicer moore 
positive place location bonus rate fair keeping mund rate 
3 blocks pike market central 
walked space needle say good mile walk definitely do-able 
coffee block direction leave building.another minor benefit internet access lobby post 15 min time limit use time.i probably n't stay 
stayed hostel place think hostel like

good budget option stayed 2 nights single room shared bath 
room sink mirror small tv small fan large closet 
building old rooms seen better days especially carpets 
bed sheets scratchy no egyptian cotton 
shared baths clean 
bottles cold water purchased anytime 1 reception 
staff friendly helpful 
sliding lock door broken lock doorknob key 
room overlooked street building traffic noise bothersome especially night torchlight parade seafair 
fan helped little 
second night people talking loudly walking night voices echoed halls 
sounds little miserable no different youth hostel 
location ca n't beat need cheap place crash downtown place good

street noise awake night summer.3

hesitated trying negative reviews experience 3.5 average tripadvisor works went 
way disappointed place having unrealistic expectations.i reservation directly hotel website choosing 52 european queen/single adult turned room 711 facing water 
checked saturday afternoon 2:30. room sink linens perfectly clean appearance feel smell 
tap water tasted fine let run filling glass old building 
decor not worth mentioning just complete hodgepodge cheap motel style definition unattractive n't remarkably ugly 
3 sets towels 4 cups 4 bars soap 
no clock ask wakeup use tv track time reception n't great channels news weather fine toilet hall little concrete cell clean 
bathroom right corner roomy clean dry 
did n't use sink room no problem getting plenty hot water shower 
water pressure stronger adequate 
wait toilet shower nor did people waiting use them.there rowdy neighbors late saturday night expected easy sleeper did n't bother 
street/city noise outside nothing extraordinary lived urban setting 
time room spent getting ready sleep n't experience noise theater downstairs ca n't comment that.the homeless direct downtown seattle quite professional not big deal 
impression just exercising right ask money turn respected right say no.i really enjoyed stay no fuss no frills no ugly surprises concentrate things

highly highly recommend staying you鈥檙e seattle ask specifically room 711 rooms in-facing there鈥檚 kind space running center hotel in-facing rooms open fresh air鈥 it鈥檚 not pretty view south-facing rooms alley.there 1 public-use internet terminal wireless access lobby 
workers helpful suggestions provide big rack literature tourist-y things-to-do

didn鈥檛 families 
no pool arcade adjoining lounge/bar theatre unfortunately playing gets touring bands now-and-then

saved money staying shared bath suites 
convieniently room sink 
room clean bare decoration 
shared bath little uncomfortable use 
walk tiled step getting tub no bath matts 
no space near tub hang towel 
shut window evening noise street turned fan louder sleep earplugs 
actually not big deal.the staff nice helpful 
recommended nearby grocery store late night sweets.being able walk pike place market took 5 minutes helped limited sightseeing time seattle.to sum room uninspiring location price worth 1 night stay

no-frills ca n't better money 
loved 
boyfriend stayed moore hotel 6 years ago cross-country trip suggested stay recent trip seattle let care vacation plans 
took public transit mt194 1.25 seatac lets 3 blocks hotel easy walk 
place fantastic money n't require lot extras 
offer shared private baths private baths pretty quickly tried 
shared bath option gives sink room 
hotel feels like hostel old not best visual condition hallways little dark elevator holds couple people doors rooms require actual keys 
neighborhood little gritty felt unsafe time 
highly trafficked area seldom wandering 
inside room pretty bare bones setup super clean functional fantastic view water building constructed like prison plaster walls heard peep neighbors 
close proximity just amazing walked pioneer square minutes safeco park minutes pike place market 5 minutes took quick bus ride seattle center 
place central need explore seattle efficiently thoroughly.if fancypants-type accomodations need lot catering place not 
no clocks room no pictures wall may/may not mirror room place worth money save service received working 5-star 
definitely lifelong customer guy 
moore hotel located smack border belltown loaded great eats great bars tons twenty/thirty-something hispters 
food check le pichet dahlia lounge mama mexican kitchen ohanas caffe d'arte awesome coffee/teas skip starbucks/tully 
entertainment virigina inn nice place grab beer places like lava lounge shorty coney island whiskey bar chaotic good fun

reached area 11 night totally confused hotel 
maybe just tired.by way reviewers mention hotel couple blocks pike market 
true extremely steep decline stewart virginia 
save punishment knees walking 2nd ave pike street market 
want good exercise walk uphill stewart hotel 
majority market does n't start opening 10am takes 1/2 hour setup

flaws preferable hi seattle moore hotel touted grand hotel emphasis placed 
lobby appears relatively modern internal decor/style rooms reminiscent 1940s 
rooms basic say pay moore represents fair value 
tv room damaged poor sound quality bed slightly uncomfortable 
rooms not appear functioning heating built fan/cooler/heaters bit drawback depending visit 
rooms clean desk staff incredibly helpful welcoming 
got free upgrade room ensuite 
internet access free lobby moore downtown location good 
travellers considering staying mediocre hostelling international seattle seriously consider staying moore instead 
location better safer cleaner price virtually considering private room hi

dont fooled like stayed month terribly disappointed 
reading great reviews moore tripadvisor decided best place stay seattle great price 
ended spending 69 night steal downtown seattle 
moment pulled soon realized cheap.first ghetto dt seattle 
2 blocks consider bad moore situated right middle bad town 
second taken strong smell pine sol entered room 
leaving evening returning room discovered pine sol scent strong masking smell urine room 
believe cleaning people tried rid urine smell bombarding room cleaning supplies 
tried air room noise street unbearable good night sleep.last not no said booked room not parking 
understand hotels downtown paid parking moore nothing 
options 1 leave car street middle ghetto desk bad idea 2 pay parking garage 40 day.my suggestion considering moore want low price stay outside dt pay parking anyways break bank stay nicer place oh yeah- sheets dirty
